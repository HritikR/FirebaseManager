# Firebase Manager

**Firebase Manager** is a tool that helps you quickly test and explore Firebase projects. Itâ€™s made for pentesters and researchers who often come across Firebase configs while reverse engineering websites.

Instead of writing new code every time, Firebase Manager lets you plug in a config and start testing right away.

### Why I Built This

While pentesting or analyzing web apps, I often find Firebase being used for things like:

- Firestore (database)
- Authentication
- Storage

To test them, I used to copy the config, write boilerplate code, figure out collection names, etc. Doing this over and over again was slow and annoying.

So I built **Firebase Manager** to automate and speed up the process.

## Features

- **Easy Setup**

  - Drop a config file
  - Paste a JSON string
  - just paste the `firebaseConfig` constant from the JS code (best option).

- **Authentication Testing**

  - Sign in with email and password
  - Useful for checking if authentication is working or misconfigured

- **Firestore Explorer**

  - Query any collection
  - Use filters like `where` and `limit`
  - No need to hardcode collection names
  - Saves collection name to localStorage

- **Storage Explorer**

  - Browse public files in Firebase Storage (if access is allowed)
  - View file info or download them
